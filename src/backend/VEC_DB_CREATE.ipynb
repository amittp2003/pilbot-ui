      "-Institutional Values and Best Practices-2022-23-2021-22-About-view Best Practices 2022-23 (.pdf)-view Best Practices 2021-22 (.pdf)--Creating Impact Through Centers of Excellence in Research, Consultancy and Entrepreneurship-Objective of the Practice:-Creating Impact Through Centers of Excellence in Research, Consultancy and Entrepreneurship-The institute requires that its faculty do innovative and impactful research in various fields. In order to do this it is required that the institute identifies areas of research where faculty can complement each other’s specialization. It is also required that facilities such as equipment and software be made available, industry partners identified, and strategies be developed to commercialize the research work being done. PCE has taken an initiative to strengthen its research and industry connections by setting up centers of excellence in various fields.-Creating Impact Through Centers of Excellence in Research, Consultancy and Entrepreneurship-The basic objectives of the centers are:-Creating Impact Through Centers of Excellence in Research, Consultancy and Entrepreneurship-Improve faculty research output by providing facilities, infrastructure, software etc in certain focus areas.-Motivate students to become entrepreneurs to contribute for nation development.-Skill development of faculty through consultancy projects and MOUs with industries.-Creating Impact Through Centers of Excellence in Research, Consultancy and Entrepreneurship--Creating Impact Through Centers of Excellence in Research, Consultancy and Entrepreneurship-The Context:Even though the institute received its first major research grant in 2007, there was a lack of research initiative among the faculty. Most of the research is done in an uncoordinated and disconnected manner. It was noted that faculty should be encouraged to publish papers in quality journals. Upto 2014 the institute lacked any focus areas where facilities can be created and faculty expertise can be developed. Prior to 2012, there were very few MOUs, consultancy projects and research initiatives in the institute. Also the research that was being done did not have much relevance to society and not many companies were being inspired by the work being done by the institute. Since the resources of the institute are limited it was decided that the institute would pick only certain focus areas of research in which it would excel.-Creating Impact Through Centers of Excellence in Research, Consultancy and Entrepreneurship-The Practice:The various practices which are followed at the institute are:-Creating Impact Through Centers of Excellence in Research, Consultancy and Entrepreneurship-1.
