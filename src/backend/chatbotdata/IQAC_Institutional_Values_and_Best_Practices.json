Most of the research is done in an uncoordinated and disconnected manner. It was noted that faculty should be encouraged to publish papers in quality journals. Upto 2014 the institute lacked any focus areas where facilities can be created and faculty expertise can be developed. Prior to 2012, there were very few MOUs, consultancy projects and research initiatives in the institute. Also the research that was being done did not have much relevance to society and not many companies were being inspired by the work being done by the institute. Since the resources of the institute are limited it was decided that the institute would pick only certain focus areas of research in which it would excel."
